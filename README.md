# Superb

> **Work in Progress!**
> This project is under development as of *December 2021*.

## About

Superb is a collection of libraries for a creative, productive and enjoyable development
experience with PHP. At [Dorkodu](https://dorkodu.com), we wanted to have some "super" stuff for dealing with common
problems in backend world, so here what we built: **Superb**!

This collection includes alsoâ€¦

- Simple **HTTP & routing** interface.
- Fast and easy to use **file, session** and **cache** storage.
- Expressive and fast **database** abstraction.

## Getting Started

We really want that Superb will have an extensive and thorough documentation. 
So we need some more time. Thanks for the patience :)
